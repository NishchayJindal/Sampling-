Overview

SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) is used to generate synthetic samples for the minority class, helping to balance an imbalanced dataset.

Steps Taken:

Loaded the dataset.

Split the data into features (X) and target (y).

Applied SMOTE to oversample the training data, balancing the minority class.

Sampling Techniques

Random Sampling: Selected random samples from the dataset.

Stratified Sampling: Ensured class proportions were preserved in the sampled data.

Systematic Sampling: Selected samples at fixed intervals.

Cluster Sampling: Randomly selected clusters of data points.

Oversampling with Replacement: Repeated samples were included to balance the dataset.

Machine Learning Models

M1: Logistic Regression

M2: Decision Tree

M3: Random Forest

M4: Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

M5: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Best Model: Random Forest (M3)

Reasons for Selection:

Highest Accuracy: Achieved the best accuracy metrics across all evaluations.

Robust Performance: Consistent results regardless of the sampling technique.

Reliability: Performed exceptionally well across multiple scenarios, making it the most dependable choice for this dataset.
